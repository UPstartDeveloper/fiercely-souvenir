**Name**: [Zain Raza](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper)

**About Me**: I am an 18 year-old student at Make School, a new college in San Francisco that teaches innovators how to build, design, and ship software products that can change the world.
I was born in Pakistan, and grew up in the Northeastern United States.
I have been traveling by plane since the age of two when my family moved to the U.S. from Pakistan.
I was inspired to start this project because of all the horror stories my friends and I have, of being frustrated with the systems in current airports and airlines.


**Feature**: Initial work on building the frontend, configuring the database schema, and using Django to figure the view controllers, as well as the main features such as posting Trip, Airlines, Reviews, and social shares through the Facebook API.

**Technologies**: Django, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap 4

**Fun Fact**: When I'm not coding, I love interviewing devs and startup founders about personal development - you can follow my podcast *[In the Making](https://anchor.fm/zain-raza)* to hear some of my conversations!
